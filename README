MHutils-1.0.0   Oct 23, 2014
=============================
Various utilities I found useful that are needed on a regular basis. 
Not really meant to be specific to any project. Just stuff that comes up 
on a regular basis.

Also the dumping ground for a bunch of various utils that don't fit 
anywhere.

Offers following modules for import
    msgutils - Messaging & printing utils 
    testutils - Testutils is needed for regression reporting. Convenient set of 
                functions for pretty reporting & such
    MTable - My own class for working w/2D tables. Not as sophisticated as pandas
             but sometimes more convenient & faster for small stuff.
